# Python datasets analysis 💻

Python practices: Handling CSV files of several rows to get important information by graphics, using matplotlib and pandas libraries for Python.

## Let's get started 🚀

_This directory will allow you to see different practices which were implemented to know important information of each CSV file. 🙂_

See **Deployment** for how to run the resulting .py file.

## Deployment 📦

To test each of the points together or one by one, just use the **python** command, and then the name of the file that we have created to carry out the previous steps:

```
(venv) PS C:\Root> python nombrearchivo.py

```
